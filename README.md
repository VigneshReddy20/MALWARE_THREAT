# CROSS-PLATFORM CLIPBOARD ATTACKING AND DEFENSE MECHANISMS

## Purpose

We wanted to present an attack exploding the cross platform enabled clipboard mechanism in the modern ecosystem such as Apple Ecosystem or Windows Ecosystem.

## How to install and Execute

Install python in your Mac or Windows device.
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Make sure you have multiple devices within the ecosystem and all are logged in using the same emailId. In case of Apple it would be email id of your iCloud account.

Now install the Python's Pyperclip module.

    pip install pyperclip

Then once you have the required devices in the ecosystem and the required software installed in any one of the device which is a part of the ecosystem.

Clone the following GitHub repository to get the attack scripts.

    git clone https://github.com/VigneshReddy20/MALWARE_THREAT.git

Now to run the attack use the following command in the cloned directory.

    python3 clipboard_attack.py
   
  Then the daemon process will run in the background collecting all the clipboard information from all the different devices which are part of the ecosystem

To run the daemon process which we have developed as a simple counter measure to avoid this type of attack run the following command to execute the daemon script for prevention.

    python3 defense.py
